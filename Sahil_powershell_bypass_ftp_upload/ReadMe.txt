It use PowerShell libraries to run PowerShell script (sahil_ftp.ps1 in my case) instead of executing PowerShell.exe. This as a result, it bypass the PowerShell restriction.
The Sahil_powershell_bypass_ftp_upload.exe file execute the sahil_ftp.ps1 file. Make sure to modify sahil_ftp.ps1 file as per the requirement and keep both the files in the same directory.
